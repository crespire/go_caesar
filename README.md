# Caesar Cipher

Caesar, in Golang.

It works! It's not very idiomatic, as it is heavily based on my Ruby cipher.

# Key Learning
1. Slices are cool.
1. Maps are cool (though I didn't use them here)
1. Go supports pointers, which is cool.
1. Variadic functions are just like Ruby `*args` but they all have to be the same type.

# Opportunity
* Can I convert `getOffset` into an anonymous function/closure? I think I can.
